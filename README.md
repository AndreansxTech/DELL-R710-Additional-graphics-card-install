__Before doing anything mentioned below please read the whole article__</br>
In the following article I am going to show and explain the proccess of installing an additional GPU to a Dell PowerEdge R710 server.</br>
Please keep in mind that I am __NOT__ responsible for any damage done to your hardware during an attempt to do what I show here.</br>
__Remember that the following article is partially universal, so for example the modding of the riser in Dell R710 will also apply to the R610 riser.__
## Prerequisites
Before you begin with installing a GPU into that R710, you need to:
- Have a basic toolkit (screwdrivers, wire cutters etc.)
- You need to have a soldering iron. I highly advise you to __NOT__ use a typical transformer soldering iron. Instead you should use a precise soldering iron, most likely with a flat-edge soldering tip.
- Of course you need to have some flux and solder
- Also, you most definetly need to have a basic knowledge about things like soldering and electronics.</br>
I strongly advise you to only do this if you do know what you are doing. Remember that there are multiple tutorials on Youtube and if something in my article will be unclear to you, just check the videos that other people made.</br>

## What will you need to buy
First of all you need to get your wanted GPU.
